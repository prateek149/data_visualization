            The health sector in India has been at the receiving end of interest and attention in the past few years. The most recent regulation 
                that provides for a paid maternity leave of 24 weeks to new mothers is a latest step in this direction which followed suit
                with the Maternity Benefits program (MBP) However, little has been achieved in terms of maternal and child health improvements. 
                Recent announcements in the 2017 Union budget provided a small boost to India’s expenditure on health (1.6% of GDP) with litle
                cognizance of the fact that several other measures are needed to ensure effective quality of healthcare in public health facilities. 
                The Janani Suraksha Yojana was aimed to promote institutional delivery amongst mothers in India, but without the provision of
                effective quality of services at institutions, a large proportion of women still remain excluded from the fold of formal healthcare. 
                Studies have found that the JSY program has, to some extent, been successful in bringing women to the public health facilities 
                (largely in primary health centres) with little impact on maternal and infant mortality rates (insert some numbers here). 
                Although caesarean deliveries are not the best estimators of quality of healthcare services provided, they are practical 
                determinants of ........
                
                Of late, there have been several discussions on whether a particular level of C-section deliveries would be considered healthy 
                for a country. WHO estimates ideal c-section rate to be in the range of 10-15% whereas more recent studies have suggested that the rate could be as high as 20%. 
                Considering, a rate of 10% to 20% as the benchmark, we find that c-section rates in India are either too low, indicating lack of access to proper care, 
                or too high, indicating lack of regulation on private sector healthcare providers. For the country as a whole, the rate of C-section deliveries is 
                X, which places it along the likes of better performing countries (cite the paper that was used for the graphic and potentially include the graphic as well). 
                
        <p>
                
        <h2> C-Section Rates: Too Low or Too High </h2>
        <p> 
            - C-sections are needed to deal with complicated delivery cases, and could help save lives. C-Section delivery needs to be performed by a qualified surgeon/gynaecologist and so c-section rate is, in some ways, a proxy of access to maternal care. <br><br>
                The following map displays the rates of C-section deliveries across all the districts in India. Aside from Gujarat, and Jammu and Kahsmir, for which no data is available in any of the major health surveys in India,
                there are substantial variations in the number of ceasarean deliveries across the country. Telengana (on the extreme high end) and parts of
                Rajasthan, M.P, Chattisgarh stand out for low levels of ceasarean deliveries.

        <h3> What is driving the high c-section rate? </h3>
        
        <p>
            - The common perception is that the private sector is driving up the c-section rate. Reasons for this <br>
            ---- Information asymmetry between the doctor and the patient leading to over provision of elective surgeries <br>
            ---- Private sector responding to the high demand for c-section <br><br>
            - To some extent, the data corroborates this. In 85% of the districts, c-section rates among the deliveries conducted in private institutions is more than 20%. Same is true for only 12% of the districts in case of deliveries conducted at public institutions. <br><br>

        <p>
            - C-section rates in private institutions are high across the board. And so the variation that we see the aggregate c-section rates across in India depend on two factors <br>
            ---- % of deliveries happening at private institutions <br>
            ---- % of c-section deliveries in public institutions <br><br>
            - And we see both of these factors prevalent in southern states <br><br>

        <p>
            - In more developed states, woman (or rather households) are choosing private institutions for delivery. Even though cost of delivery is much higher in private institutions <br><br>
            - NSS Round 71 data, gives us a sense why people are choosing private over public institutions. Household members who were ill over the past 15 days, and sought treatment at a private facility, were asked why they didn’t go to a govt. facility <br>
            ---- 43% of them felt that the quality of govt facility was not good <br>
            ---- 27% cited long wait times <br>
            ---- 12% said the facility was too far <br>
            ---- 10% said that no government facility was available. <br><br>
            - As such, combination of access and perceived quality of care could be driving people to private institutions <br><br>
        </p>


        <h3> What can we conclude? </h3>
        
        <p>
            - The government has an overarching focus on building more facilities but all that investment would not improve outcomes if the quality, and the perception of quality, does not improve. <br><br>
            - It is estimated that as high as 70% of people go to a private health service provider. And, they often do a good job of providing services that public infrastructure is failing to provide. So regulating the private sector should be high on their agenda. <br><br>
            - Case for setting different priorities in different regions? <br><br>
