        <h2> C-Section Rates: Too Low or Too High </h2>
        <p> 
            - C-sections are needed to deal with complicated delivery cases, and could help save lives. C-Section delivery needs to be performed by a qualified surgeon/gynaecologist and so c-section rate is, in some ways, a proxy of access to maternal care. <br><br>

            - WHO estimates ideal c-section rate to be in the range of 10-15%. More recent studies have suggested that the rate could be as high as 20%.   <br>
            ---- Considering, a rate of 10% to 20% as the benchmark, we find that c-section rates in India are either too low, indicating lack of access to proper care, or too high.<br>
        </p>

        <h3> What is driving the high c-section rate? </h3>
        
        <p>
            - The common perception is that the private sector is driving up the c-section rate. Reasons for this <br>
            ---- Information asymmetry between the doctor and the patient leading to over provision of elective surgeries <br>
            ---- Private sector responding to the high demand for c-section <br><br>
            - To some extent, the data corroborates this. In 85% of the districts, c-section rates among the deliveries conducted in private institutions is more than 20%. Same is true for only 12% of the districts in case of deliveries conducted at public institutions.
