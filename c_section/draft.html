        <h2> C-Section Rates: Too Low or Too High </h2>
        <p> 
            - C-sections are needed to deal with complicated delivery cases, and could help save lives. C-Section delivery needs to be performed by a qualified surgeon/gynaecologist and so c-section rate is, in some ways, a proxy of access to maternal care. <br><br>

            - WHO estimates ideal c-section rate to be in the range of 10-15%. More recent studies have suggested that the rate could be as high as 20%.   <br>
            ---- Considering, a rate of 10% to 20% as the benchmark, we find that c-section rates in India are either too low, indicating lack of access to proper care, or too high.<br>
        </p>

        <h3> What is driving the high c-section rate? </h3>
        
        <p>
            - The common perception is that the private sector is driving up the c-section rate. Reasons for this <br>
            ---- Information asymmetry between the doctor and the patient leading to over provision of elective surgeries <br>
            ---- Private sector responding to the high demand for c-section <br><br>
            - To some extent, the data corroborates this. In 85% of the districts, c-section rates among the deliveries conducted in private institutions is more than 20%. Same is true for only 12% of the districts in case of deliveries conducted at public institutions. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            - C-section rates in private institutions are high across the board. And so the variation that we see the aggregate c-section rates across in India depend on two factors <br>
            ---- % of deliveries happening at private institutions <br>
            ---- % of c-section deliveries in public institutions <br><br>
            - And we see both of these factors prevalent in southern states <br><br>

        <p>
            - In more developed states, woman (or rather households) are choosing private institutions for delivery. Even though cost of delivery is much higher in private institutions <br><br>
            - NSS Round 71 data, gives us a sense why people are choosing private over public institutions. Household members who were ill over the past 15 days, and sought treatment at a private facility, where asked why they didnâ€™t go to a govt. facility <br>
            ---- 43% of them felt that the quality of govt facility was not good <br>
            ---- 27% cited long wait times <br>
            ---- 12% said the facility was too far <br>
            ---- 10% said that no government facility was available. <br><br>
            - As such, combination of access and perceived quality of care could be driving people to private institutions <br><br>
        </p>


        <h3> What can we conclude? </h3>
        
        <p>
            - The government has an overarching focus on building more facilities but all that investment would not improve outcomes if the quality, and the perception of quality, does not improve. <br><br>
            - It is estimated that as high as 70% of people go to a private health service provider. And, they often do a good job of providing services that public infrastructure is failing to provide. So regulating the private sector should be high on their agenda. <br><br>
            - Case for setting different priorities in different regions? <br><br>
