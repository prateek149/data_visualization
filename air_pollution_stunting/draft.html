        <h2>Indoor Air Pollution and Stunting Among Indian Children</h1>
        <p> 
            According to the latest WHO report on air quality, ten of the twenty most polluted cities in the world ate in India. Building on such reports, outdoor air pollution issues have gained a lot of media traction in India. However, the conversation on indoor air quality has not gained such attention. Similarly, while asthma and the other health consequences of outdoor air pollution are increasingly well known, the health risks associated with common indoor air pollutants are similarly profound, but much less publicized. Our analysis of the 2005-2006 National Family Health Survey finds strong evidence that the exposure to indoor air pollution from burning solid fuels increases the probability of stunting among Indian children.

        <h3>Stunting is a big problem in India</h2>
        <p> 
            About 43% of Indian children under five years of age were stunted as of 2006, while one in five was severely stunted. Despite high economic growth during the last few decades, India still has the highest prevalence of stunting among not only BRICS countries, but also among all South Asian economies, with the sole exception of war-stricken Afghanistan.

        <h3> Why should we care about stunting? </h3>
        
        <p>
            Stunting indicates a chronic restriction of a child’s potential growth, with severe and life-long consequences (Hoddinott et al., 2013). Stunted children tend to have both physical and cognitive developmental delays, including delayed walking, delayed speech development, and reduced school performance. They also experience higher rates of mortality and morbidity, including diabetes and hypertension. Stunted adults often encounter barriers to work due to functional limitations that are only compounded by low levels of education, continuing a cycle of poverty. They also face reduced marriage prospects.

        <h3>The connection between stunting and solid cooking fuels</h3>
        
        <p>
            In India’s kitchens that burn solid fuels — such as coal, charcoal, wood products, and animal dung, pollution is higher than in the world’s most polluted cities. Diwali-like pollution levels and even higher are not uncommon indoors.
 
            <br><br>

            The combustion of fuels results in particulate matter, carbon monoxide, benzene, formaldehyde, and other toxins, and the emission rates are much higher for solid than for non-solid fuels (such as kerosene, petrol, and electricity). The other negative health impacts of burning solid fuels during cooking have been well documented: they include visual impairment, as well as cardiovascular and respiratory disease (Branca and Ferrari, 2002; Dewey and Begum, 2011). Nevertheless, most Indian households still rely on solid fuels, mostly due to their low price and high availability; see Fig. 4 and 5.

        <p>
            Children’s developing lungs are susceptible to irritation and contamination from the fumes of solid cooking fuels; when children’s bodies must repeatedly fight off the respiratory infections these fumes provoke, their growth suffers. 

            <br><br>

            We examine data from the 2005-2006 National Family Health Survey in India to identify the main drivers of stunting among Indian children. The marginal impact of living in a household that burns solid fuels is a reduction in the height-for-age score by 0.13 standard deviations. Otherwise stated, being exposed to solid fuel smoke is solely responsible for 5% of stunting cases in Indian children below five years old. This effect is one-third stronger than, for example, living in an area where open defecation is practiced and half as impactful as following an inappropriate nutrition, which are the usual top concerns when trying to fight stunting.

        <h3>Breaking the link between indoor air pollution and childhood stunting</h3>

        <p>
            Although a fuel transition is perhaps the only solution that tackles the indoor air pollution problem at its roots, we find that there is a second option that promises to reduce stunting rapidly until the switch to cleaner fuels is achieved: In our study, we show that the negative impact of solid fuel smoke exposure on child stunting is reduced considerably when families have a way to vent the smoke effectively.  

            <br><br>

            We consider a variety of simple, low-cost ventilation solutions that are widely available. We believe these solutions are ripe for integration into health promotion campaigns that aim to mitigate the impacts of burning solid fuels for families that have not transitioned to new fuels. Fig. 6 below shows the variance in stunting prevalence between families using one common form of ventilation or another, or no ventilation at all.

        <p>
            The simple presence of a window in households burning solid fuels is associated with a 4% lower prevalence of stunting. Having separate kitchen and living areas reduces the chance of stunting by 5.5%. Cooking under a chimney reduces the chance of stunting by 3%. As our data captures only whether households possess the different ventilation options and not their actual usage, these results are likely to represent a lower bound of the mitigation effects of the venting.
