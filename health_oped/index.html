        <p> <h1>Understaffed, Underserved: Human Problems Of India’s Public-Health System </h1> <p>

        <p>   On August 15, 2016 in his independence-day address, Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised a safety net of up to Rs 100,000 for families who lived below the official poverty line. This scheme, however, may do little for people who lack access to qualified medical personnel.

        </p><p>    According to DLHS-4 data, 62% of the government hospitals don’t have a gynecologist on staff and an estimates 22% of the Sub-Centres are short of auxiliary nurse midwives (ANM)--together, gynecologists and ANMs are the frontline of the battle against infant and maternal mortality--according to our analysis of various government data. At the same time, the number of facilities is also much lower than needed which means that the actual shortfall in personnel is much higher.

        </p><p>    Our other findings: 
            * In 30% of India's districts, sub-centres with ANMs serve double the patients they are meant to. 
            * As many as 65% of hospitals serve more patients than government standards require; the number rises to a staggering 95% of hospitals with a gynecologist on staff
            * Almost 80% of all public hospitals serve twice the number of patients that government standards specify  

        </p><p>    The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005 to provide affordable healthcare in rural areas, improve healthcare quality and reduce maternal and infant mortality. In 2013, the mission was rebranded as the National Health Mission (NHM) with two components- NRHM and National Urban Health Mission (NUHM). The budget outlay for NRHM in 2005-06 was Rs 6,713 crore which has now risen to Rs 19,037 crore for NHM in 2015-16. And, through the roll-out of Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) insurance program, the government of India has demonstrated a concerted effort to help the poor pay for medical expenses. But as the number of primary health centres have risen from 23,236 in 2005 to 25,308 in 2015, according to Rural Health Statistics (RHS) data, a critical element of the public-health system continues to falter::hospitals’ rosters of doctors and nurses remain lamentably short.

        </p><p>    Our analysis of India’s District Level Household Survey  (DLHS) data reveals that a large proportion of healthcare facilities across India don’t have the required number of trained medical personnel on staff, creating impossible caseloads for those on duty. This problem is most pronounced in public hospitals and rural areas, which serve the most vulnerable Indian citizens. 

        </p><p>    Why vacancies require more attention than absenteeism
            Much has been written about absenteeism amongst public sector employees and its impact on basic public services, including its impact on the quality of health services (here and here). The absenteeism rate across the public education and health sectors in India was 40%, tying with Indonesia, according to this 2006 study conducted across primary schools and primary health centres in six countries.
            Much less attention has focused on the high levels of vacancies in public-sector employment and especially the public-health system. While the number of healthcare facilities across India has increased substantially, as we indicated, the count of medical personnel has not kept pace—and rural facilities have the largest gap between the supply and demand of basic health services, as measured by vacancies. 

        </p><p>    Since the launch of NRHM two rounds of DLHS (round 3 in 2008 and round 4 in 2013) reveal the staffing gaps in maternal and child health. 

        </p><p>    Gynaecologists play a crucial role in ensuring safe and healthy pregnancies and deliveries. Even with the increase in the number of facilities nationally, the number of practicing gynaecologists has not increased significantly. In 2008, the number of government hospitals, including CHCs, sub-district hospitals (SDHs) and district hospitals (DHs) was 4,423, of which only 1,633, or 37%, had a gynaecologist. In 2014, the number of hospitals rose to 6,318, but only 2,409, or 38%,  had a gynaecologist. 

        </p><p>    In short, DLHS-4 indicates that close to 62% of hospitals do not have a gynecologist on staff.
